<h2>Data Storage and Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>Important: We do not collect or store any personal information on our servers.</strong></p>
<p>All game data (including your progress, settings, stars, purchased items, and achievements) is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>The Application uses third-party services that may collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information to improve the app experience:</p>

<h3>Anonymous Analytics</h3>
<p>We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous usage statistics, such as:</p>
<ul>

  <li>General usage patterns (e.g., which features are used)</li>
  <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
  <li>Anonymous identifiers (no personal information)</li>
</ul>
<p>This information helps us improve the app's performance and user experience. <strong>No personally identifiable information is collected.</strong></p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>The Application displays advertisements through <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect and process information for personalized advertising purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising ID (a resettable, anonymous identifier)</li>

  <li>Ad interaction data</li>
</ul>
<p>You can opt-out of personalized advertising in your device settings. For more information, see Google's privacy policy below.</p>
